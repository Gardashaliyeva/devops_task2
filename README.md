# devops_task2

In this task, I have created a simple web application, set up a GitLab repository, implemented Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitLab CI/CD, and deployed the application using Docker. The goal is to understand how to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of a containerized application.
